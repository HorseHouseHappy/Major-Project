# Project Reflection


## Problems
- I struggle to consistently do work at home and I get distracted easily, because of that I get more behind than other people then during class time I get stressed that other
people will see how far behind I am and get even less work done.

- I'm really bad at asking for help or even just accepting it.

- It was diffucult to  find documentation or things about what I was trying to do in my project, mainly regarding the rhythm and BPM aspects so I mostly had to try to cobble 
together ways to make it work. I'm not sure if this was because I didn't use the correct terminology while searching or if there is just not that much information about what I want


## Future Advice
- Let the teacher help you.

- Try not to get too worried about being behind because that just leads to you being even further behind.

- Try to work on the project more consistently.

## Needs To Have
Despite my efforts I didn't manage to get everything on my Needs To Have list done, even after my expecations were lowered.


## Hardest Part
The hardest part for me was getting the beat system set up. It took multiple attempts and while I did manage to get it to work I couldn't get it and the song that plays to be in 
sync.


## Problems I Couldn't Solve
As mentioned above I had issues with getting the timing of the music and when the code would start counting the beats to be in sync, this could be due to me just making stupid 
mistakes or my method of counting the time between the beats in the first place. I also had problems with getting enemies to behave properly, even if their movements are simple
like moving in a square pattern. That would also prevent me from adding a health system as there wouldn't be anthing to be hurt by in the first place, I could have added some
icons but it would just be pointless since they would be completely non-functional (almost like most of the project).
