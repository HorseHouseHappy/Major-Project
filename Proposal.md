# Proposal

I'll be trying to make a coppy of the game Crypt Of The Necrodancer. It is a rhythm based 2D game where you control a character and move throughout a level defeating ememies and gaining items and money, but only on the beats of a song.

## Needs To Have
- Movement and actions locked to the beat of the song playing.
- A map with music.
- An that can either chase the player or move in a pattern, also to the beat of the song.
- Health indicator and item slots.
- Hand made maps.

## Nice To Have
- More enemies.
- More maps.
- Add bosses.
- Add shops.
- Add a money multiplier that gets reset when you move not on a beat or when you're attacked.
- Digable walls with things hidden in them.
- Decent looking sprites.
- Add range of vision.
- Add minimap?
- Traps.
- Variations of the basic zone tiles.
