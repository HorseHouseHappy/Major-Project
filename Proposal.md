#Proposal
I'll be trying to make a coppy of the game Crypt Of The Necrodancer. It is a rhythm based 2D game where you control a character and move throughout a level defeating ememies and gaining items and money, but only on the beats of a song.

## Needs To Have
-Movement and actions locked to the beat of the song playing.
-A few different maps with different music and beats.
-A few enemy types that can either chase the player or move in a pattern, also to the beat of the song.
-Health indicator and item slots.
-Hand made maps.

## Nice To Have
-More enemies.
-Add bosses.
-Add shops.
-Add a money multiplier that gets reset when you move not on a beat or when youre attacked.
-Digable walls with things hidden in them.
-Decent looking sprites.
-Add range of vision.
-Add minimap?
